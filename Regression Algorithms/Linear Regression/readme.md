# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a standard statistical method that enables the user to visualize and form a relationship between 2 continous variables. In other words, it is a model wherein the model assumes that there is a linear relationship between the y and x axis and when that relationship is found it is able to predict y in terms of x.<br><br>

This relationship is attained by passing some initial relationship between x and y and then perfecting it by trying to minimize the difference between the point and the line at a given x co-ordinate.<br><br>
