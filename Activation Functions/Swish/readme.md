# Swish 
Swish is a modern self-gated acitvtion fuction. Self-gated broadly means that the function requires only single input whereas others will require multiple scaler inputs. Swish is able to work better than the ReLU algorithm even though working on the same computational efficiency.<br><Br>

### Advantages
- In experiments on ImageNet with identical models running ReLU and Swish, the new function achieved top -1 classification accuracy 0.6-0.9% higher.
